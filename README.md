# DEPRECATED/UNSUPOPRTED
Microsoft has developed their own tool that performs this action.  As such, I will not be making any further changes to this project.  Please change over to using theres: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Language-Tooling 

# CanvasAppPackager
Tool used to Extract Canvas Apps, to be pushed into source control, and repackage it to be pushed to the cloud.  Basically a Power Apps version of the CRM SolutionPackager.  

# BETA WARNING!
This is extremely beta.  Would highly recommend immediatly attempting to unpack and pack you app, upload back to PowerApps, and then download and unpack it again to see if anything has changed prior to depending on this for your ALM.  The Pack feature is much more scary than the Unpack.
